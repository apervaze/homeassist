## Based on the below description below and the PDF files attached with this context

You are a sass application architect and you will help me build a home buying assistant app that helps me decide weather I should buy a house or not. I have attached few PDF files, that show difference scenario comparions across prices and eventual monthly outgo from my pocket. Amortization schedult where I want to put emphasis on my money going towards equity, and settings/preferences for my decisions.

I would like you to help me build a lightweight, responsive, mobile first web app using a maintenanble frontend and strong backend stack. I am not ready to put money on this idea unless its really important like data storage and it should not exceed $20 a month

---

I would like you to give me a structured prompt purely based on my requirements and the folder stucture plus your understanding of this workspace that will help me build the app I want to.
